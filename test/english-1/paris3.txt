THE PARIS PEACE TREATY (PEACE TREATY of 1783):

of the most serene and most potent Prince George the Third, by 
the grace of God, king of Great Britain, France, and Ireland, 
defender of the faith, duke of Brunswick and Lunebourg, arch-
treasurer and prince elector of the Holy Roman Empire etc., and 
of the United States of America, to forget all past misunderstandings 
and differences that have unhappily interrupted the good 
correspondence and friendship which they mutually wish to restore, 
and to establish such a beneficial and satisfactory intercourse , 
between the two countries upon the ground of reciprocal advantages 
and mutual convenience as may promote and secure to both perpetual 
peace and harmony; and having for this desirable end already laid 
the foundation of peace and reconciliation by the Provisional 
Articles signed at Paris on the 30th of November 1782, by the 
commissioners empowered on each part, which articles were agreed 
to be inserted in and constitute the Treaty of Peace proposed to 
be concluded between the Crown of Great Britain and the said United 
States, but which treaty was not to be concluded until terms of 
peace should be agreed upon between Great Britain and France and 
his Britannic Majesty should be ready to conclude such treaty 
accordingly; and the treaty between Great Britain and France 
having since been concluded, his Britannic Majesty and the United 
States of America, in order to carry into full effect the 
Provisional Articles above mentioned, according to the tenor 
thereof, have constituted and appointed, that is to say his

time heretofore to fish.  And also that the inhabitants of the 
United States shall have liberty to take fish of every kind on

Majesty's dominions in America; and that the American fishermen

Congress shall also earnestly recommend to the several states 
that the estates, rights, and properties, of such last mentioned

destruction, or carrying away any Negroes or other property of 
the American inhabitants, withdraw all his armies, garrisons, and

and harbor within the same; leaving in all fortifications, the 
American artilery that may be therein; and shall also order and 
cause all archives, records, deeds, and papers belonging to any

The Peace Treaty of 1783, also known as The Paris Peace Treaty, 
ended the United States War for Independence.  Representing 
England was Richard Oswald, chief negotiator under the Earl of 
Shelburne, the Secretary of State; signing for Britain was David 
Hartley.  Representing the United States of America were John 
Adams, Benjamin Franklin, and John Jay, all of whom signed the treaty.

This treaty gave formal recognition to the United States of America, 
established her boundaries, (at the time), secured certain fishing 
rights, addressed problems between creditors, provided fair treatment 
for those who decided to remain loyal to Great Britain, and opened up 
the Mississippi River to navigation by citizens of both signatory 
nations.
