U.N.T.S. No. 11851, vol. 828, pp. 305-388

                         PARIS CONVENTION 
     FOR THE PROTECTION OF INDUSTRIAL PROPERTY OF MARCH 20, 1883, 

           AS REVISED AT BRUSSELS ON DECEMBER 14, 1900, 
    AT WASHINGTON ON JUNE 2, 1911, AT THE HAGUE ON NOVEMBER 6, 1925, 
      AT LONDON ON JUNE 2, 1934, AT LISBON ON OCTOBER 31, 1958, 
                 AND AT STOCKHOLM ON JULY 14, 1967


                              Article 1

(1) The countries to which this Convention applies constitute a Union for
the protection of industrial property.

(2) The protection of industrial property has as its object patents,
utility models, industrial designs, trademarks, service marks, trade names,
indications of source or appellations of origin, and the repression of
unfair competition.

(3) Industrial property shall be understood in the broadest sense and shall
apply not only to industry and commerce proper, but likewise to
agricultural and extractive industries and to all manufactured or natural
products, for example, wines, grain, tobacco leaf, fruit, cattle, minerals,
mineral waters, beer, flowers, and flour.

(4) Patents shall include the various kinds of industrial patents
recognized by the laws of the countries of the Union, such as patents of
importation, patents of improvement, patents and certificates of addition,
etc.

                              Article 2

(1) Nationals of any country of the Union shall, as regards the protection
of industrial property, enjoy in all the other countries of the Union the
advantages that their respective laws now grant, or may hereafter grant, to
nationals; all without prejudice to the rights specially provided for by
this Convention. Consequently, they shall have the same protection as the
latter, and the same legal remedy against any infringement of their rights,
provided that the conditions and formalities imposed upon nationals are
complied with.

(2) However, no requirement as to domicile or establishment in the country
where protection is claimed may be imposed upon nationals of countries of
the Union for the enjoyment of any industrial property rights.

(3) The provisions of the laws of each of the countries of the Union
relating to judicial and administrative procedure and to jurisdiction, and
to the designation of an address for service or the appointment of an
agent, which may be required by the laws on industrial property are
expressly reserved.

                              Article 3

Nationals of countries outside the Union who are domiciled or who have real
and effective industrial or commercial establishments in the territory of
one of the countries of the Union shall be treated in the same manner as
nationals of the countries of the Union.

                              Article 4

A. (1) Any person who has duly filed an application for a patent, or for
the registration of a utility model, or of an industrial design, or of a
trademark, in one of the countries of the Union, or his successor in title,
shall enjoy, for the purpose of filing in the other countries, a right of
priority during the periods hereinafter fixed.

(2) Any filing that is equivalent to a regular national filing under the
domestic legislation of any country of the Union or under bilateral or
multilateral treaties concluded between countries of the Union shall be
recognized as giving rise to the right of priority.

(3) By a regular national filing is meant any filing that is adequate to
establish the date on which the application was filed in the country
concerned, whatever may be the subsequent fate of the application.

B. Consequently, any subsequent filing in any of the other countries of the
Union before the expiration of the periods referred to above shall not be
invalidated by reason of any acts accomplished in the interval, in
particular, another filing, the publication or exploitation of the
invention, the putting on sale of copies of the design, or the use of the
mark, and such acts cannot give rise to any third-party right or any right
of personal possession. Rights acquired by third parties before the date of
the first application that serves as the basis for the right of priority
are reserved in accordance with the domestic legislation of each country of
the Union.

C. (1) The periods of priority referred to above shall be twelve months for
patents and utility models, and six months for industrial designs and
trademarks.

(2) These periods shall start from the date of filing of the first
application; the day of filing shall not be included in the period.

(3) If the last day of the period is an official holiday, or a day when the
Office is not open for the filing of applications in the country where
protection is claimed, the period shall be extended until the first
following working day.

(4) A subsequent application concerning the same subject as a previous
first application within the meaning of paragraph (2), above, filed in the
same country of the Union, shall be considered as the first application, of
which the filing date shall be the starting point of the period of
priority, if, at the time of filing the subsequent application, the said
previous application has been withdrawn, abandoned, or refused, without
having been laid open to public inspection and without leaving any rights
outstanding, and if it has not yet served as a basis for claiming a right
of priority. The previous application may not thereafter serve as a basis
for claiming a right of priority.

D. (1) Any person desiring to take advantage of the priority of a previous
filing shall be required to make a declaration indicating the date of such
filing and the country in which it was made. Each country shall determine
the latest date on which such declaration must be made.

(2) These particulars shall be mentioned in the publications issued by the
competent authority, and in particular in the patents and the
specifications relating thereto.

(3) The countries of the Union may require any person making a declaration
of priority to produce a copy of the application (description, drawings,
etc.) previously filed. The copy, certified as correct by the authority
which received such application, shall not require any authentication, and
may in any case be filed, without fee, at any time within three months of
the filing of the subsequent application. They may require it to be
accompanied by a certificate from the same authority showing the date of
filing, and by a translation.

(4) No other formalities may be required for the declaration of priority at
the time of filing the application. Each country of the Union shall
determine the consequences of failure to comply with the formalities
prescribed by this Article, but such consequences shall in no case go
beyond the loss of the right of priority.

(5) Subsequently, further proof may be required.

Any person who avails himself of the priority of a previous application
shall be required to specify the number of that application; this number
shall be published as provided for by paragraph (2), above.

E. (1) Where an industrial design is filed in a country by virtue of a
right of priority based on the filing of a utility model, the period of
priority shall be the same as that fixed for industrial designs.

(2) Furthermore, it is permissible to file a utility model in a country by
virtue of a right of priority based on the filing of a patent application,
and vice versa.

F. No country of the Union may refuse a priority or a patent application on
the ground that the applicant claims multiple priorities, even if they
originate in different countries, or on the ground that an application
claiming one or more priorities contains one or more elements that were not
included in the application or applications whose priority is claimed,
provided that, in both cases, there is unity of invention within the
meaning of the law of the country.

With respect to the elements not included in the application or
applications whose priority is claimed, the filing of the subsequent
application shall give rise to a right of priority under ordinary
conditions.

G. (1) If the examination reveals that an application for a patent contains
more than one invention, the applicant may divide the application into a
certain number of divisional applications and preserve as the date of each
the date of the initial application and the benefit of the right of
priority, if any.

(2) The applicant may also, on his own initiative, divide a patent
application and preserve as the date of each divisional application the
date of the initial application and the benefit of the right of priority,
if any. Each country of the Union shall have the right to determine the
conditions under which such division shall be authorized.

H. Priority may not be refused on the ground that certain elements of the
invention for which priority is claimed do not appear among the claims
formulated in the application in the country of origin, provided that the
application documents as a whole specifically disclose such elements.

I. (1) Applications for inventors' certificates filed in a country in which
applicants have the right to apply at their own option either for a patent
or for an inventor's certificate shall give rise to the right of priority
provided for by this Article, under the same conditions and with the same
effects as applications for patents.

(2) In a country in which applicants have the right to apply at their own
option either for a patent or for an inventor's certificate, an applicant
for an inventor's certificate shall, in accordance with the provisions of
this Article relating to patent applications, enjoy a right of priority
based on an application for a patent, a utility model, or an inventor's
certificate.

                              Article 4bis

(1) Patents applied for in the various countries of the Union by nationals
of countries of the Union shall be independent of patents obtained for the
same invention in other countries, whether members of the Union or not.

(2) The foregoing provision is to be understood in an unrestricted sense,
in particular, in the sense that patents applied for during the period of
priority are independent, both as regards the grounds for nullity and
forfeiture, and as regards their normal duration.

(3) The provision shall apply to all patents existing at the time when it
comes into effect.

(4) Similarly, it shall apply, in the case of the accession of new
countries, to patents in existence on either side at the time of accession.

(5) Patents obtained with the benefit of priority shall, in the various
countries of the Union, have a duration equal to that which they would
have, had they been applied for or granted without the benefit of priority.

                              Article 4ter

The inventor shall have the right to be mentioned as such in the patent.

                             Article 4quater

The grant of a patent shall not be refused and a patent shall not be
invalidated on the ground that the sale of the patented product or of a
product obtained by means of a patented process is subject to restrictions
or limitations resulting from the domestic law.

                              Article 5

A. (1) Importation by the patentee into the country where the patent has
been granted of articles manufactured in any of the countries of the Union
shall not entail forfeiture of the patent.

(2) Each country of the Union shall have the right to take legislative
measures providing for the grant of compulsory licenses to prevent the
abuses which might result from the exercise of the exclusive rights
conferred by the patent, for example, failure to work.

(3) Forfeiture of the patent shall not be provided for except in cases
where the grant of compulsory licenses would not have been sufficient to
prevent the said abuses. No proceedings for the forfeiture or revocation of
a patent may be instituted before the expiration of two years from the
grant of the first compulsory license.

(4) A compulsory license may not be applied for on the ground of failure to
work or insufficient working before the expiration of a period of four
years from the date of filing of the patent application or three years from
the date of the grant of the patent, whichever period expires last; it
shall be refused if the patentee justifies his inaction by legitimate
reasons. Such a compulsory license shall be non-exclusive and shall not be
transferable, even in the form of the grant of a sub-license, except with
that part of the enterprise or goodwill which exploits such license.

(5) The foregoing provisions shall be applicable, mutatis mutandis, to
utility models.

B. The protection of industrial designs shall not, under any circumstance,
the subject to any forfeiture, either by reason of failure to work or by
reason of the importation of articles corresponding to those which are
protected.

C. (1) If, in any country, use of the registered mark is compulsory, the
registration may be cancelled only after a reasonable period, and then only
if the person concerned does not justify his inaction.

(2) Use of a trademark by the proprietor in a form differing in elements
which do not alter the distinctive character of the mark in the form in
which it was registered in one of the countries of the Union shall not
entail invalidation of the registration and shall not diminish the
protection granted to the mark.

(3) Concurrent use of the same mark on identical or similar goods by
industrial or commercial establishments considered as co-proprietors of the
mark according to the provisions of the domestic law of the country where
protection is claimed shall not prevent registration or diminish in any way
the protection granted to the said mark in any country of the Union,
provided that such use does not result in misleading the public and is not
contrary to the public interest.

D. No indication or mention of the patent, of the utility model, of the
registration of the trademark, or of the deposit of the industrial design,
shall be required upon the goods as a condition of recognition of the right
to protection.

                              Article 5bis

(1) A period of grace of not less than six months shall be allowed for the
payment of the fees prescribed for the maintenance of industrial property
rights, subject, if the domestic legislation so provides, to the payment of
a surcharge.

(2) The countries of the Union shall have the right to provide for the
restoration of patents which have lapsed by reason of non-payment of fees.

Article 5rer

In any country of the Union the following shall not be considered as
infringements of the rights of a patentee:

  1. the use on board vessels of other countries of the Union of devices
     forming the subject of his patent in the body of the vessel, in the
     machinery, tackle, gear and other accessories, when such vessels
     temporarily or accidentally enter the waters of the said country,
     provided that such devices are used there exclusively for the needs
     of the vessel;

  2. the use of devices forming the subject of the patent in the
     construction or operation of aircraft or land vehicles of other
     countries of the Union, or of accessories of such aircraft or land
     vehicles, when those aircraft or land vehicles temporarily or
     accidentally enter the said country.

                           Article 5quater

When a product is imported into a country of the Union where there exists a
patent protecting a process of manufacture of the said product, the
patentee shall have all the rights, with regard to the imported product,
that are accorded to him by the legislation of the country of importation,
on the basis of the process patent, with respect to products manufactured
in that country.

                         Article 5quinquies

Industrial designs shall be protected in all the countries of the Union.

                              Article 6

(1) The conditions for the filing and registration of trademarks shall be
determined in each country of the Union by its domestic legislation.

(2) However, an application for the registration of a mark filed by a
national of a country of the Union in any country of the Union may not be
refused, nor may a registration be invalidated, on the ground that filing,
registration, or renewal, has not been effected in the country of origin.

(3) A mark duly registered in a country of the Union shall be regarded as
independent of marks registered in the other countries of the Union,
including the country of origin.

                              Article 6bis

(1) The countries of the Union undertake, ex officio if their legislation
so permits, or at the request of an interested party, to refuse or to
cancel the registration, and to prohibit the use, of a trademark which
constitutes a reproduction, an imitation, or a translation, liable to
create confusion, of a mark considered by the competent authority of the
country of registration or use to be well known in that country as being
already the mark of a person entitled to the benefits of this Convention
and used for identical or similar goods. These provisions shall also apply
when the essential part of the mark constitutes a reproduction of any such
well-known mark or an imitation liable to create confusion therewith.

(2) A period of at least five years from the date of registration shall be
allowed for requesting the cancellation of such a mark. The countries of
the Union may provide for a period within which the prohibition of use must
be requested.

(3) No time limit shall be fixed for requesting the cancellation or the
prohibition of the use of marks registered or used in bad faith.

A                             Article 6ter

(1) (a) The countries of the Union agree to refuse or to invalidate the
registration, and to prohibit by appropriate measures the use, without
authorization by the competent authorities, either as trademarks or as
elements of trademarks, of armorial bearings, flags, and other State
emblems, of the countries of the Union, official signs and hallmarks
indicating control and warranty adopted by them, and any imitation from a
heraldic point of view.

(b) The provisions of subparagraph (a), above, shall apply equally to
armorial bearings, flags, other emblems, abbreviations, and names, of
international intergovernmental organizations of which one or more
countries of the Union are members, with the exception of armorial
bearings, flags, other emblems, abbreviations, and names, that are already
the subject of international agreements in force, intended to ensure their
protection.

(c) No country of the Union shall be required to apply the provisions of
subparagraph (b), above, to the prejudice of the owners of rights acquired
in good faith before the entry into force, in that country, of this
Convention. The countries of the Union shall not be required to apply the
said provisions when the use or registration referred to in subparagraph
(a), above, is not of such a nature as to suggest to the public that a
connection exists between the organization concerned and the armorial
bearings, flags, emblems, abbreviations, and names, or if such use or
registration is probably not of such a nature as to mislead the public as
to the existence of a connection between the user and the organization.

(2) Prohibition of the use of official signs and hallmarks indicating
control and warranty shall apply solely in cases where the marks in which
they are incorporated are intended to be used on goods of the same or a
similar kind.

(3) (a) For the application of these provisions, the countries of the Union
agree to communicate reciprocally, through the intermediary of the
International Bureau, the list of State emblems, and official signs and
hallmarks indicating control and warranty, which they desire, or may
hereafter desire, to place wholly or within certain limits under the
protection of this Article, and all subsequent modifications of such list.
Each country of the Union shall in due course make available to the public
the lists so communicated.

Nevertheless such communication is not obligatory in respect of flags of
States.

(b) The provisions of subparagraph (b) of paragraph (1) of this Article
shall apply only to such armorial bearings, flags, other emblems,
abbreviations, and names, of international intergovernmental organizations
as the latter have communicated to the countries of the Union through the
intermediary of the International Bureau.

(4) Any country of the Union may, within a period of twelve months from the
receipt of the notification, transmit its objections, if any, through the
intermediary of the International Bureau, to the country or international
intergovernmental organization concerned.

(5) In the case of State flags, the measures prescribed by paragraph (1),
above, shall apply solely to marks registered after November 6, 1925.

(6) In the case of State emblems other than flags, and of official signs
and hallmarks of the countries of the Union, and in the case of armorial
bearings, flags, other emblems, abbreviations, and names, of international
intergovernmental organizations, these provisions shall apply only to marks
registered more than two months after receipt of the communication provided
for in paragraph (3), above.

(7) In cases of bad faith, the countries shall have the right to cancel
even those marks incorporating State emblems, signs, and hallmarks, which
were registered before November 6, 1925.

(8) Nationals of any country who are authorized to make use of the State
emblems, signs, and hallmarks, of their country may use them even if they
are similar to those of another country.

(9) The countries of the Union undertake to prohibit the unauthorized use
in trade of the State armorial bearings of the other countries of the
Union, when the use is of such a nature as to be misleading as to the
origin of the goods.

(10) The above provisions shall not prevent the countries from exercising
the right given in paragraph (3) of Article 6quinquies, Section B, to
refuse or to invalidate the registration of marks incorporating, without
authorization, armorial bearings, flags, other State emblems, or official
signs and hallmarks adopted by a country of the Union, as well as the
distinctive signs of international intergovernmental organizations referred
to in paragraph (1), above.

                              Article 6quater

(1) When, in accordance with the law of a country of the Union, the
assignment of mark is valid only if it takes place at the same time as the
transfer of the business or goodwill to which the mark belongs, it shall
suffice for the recognition of such validity that the portion of the
business or goodwill located in that country be transferred to the
assignee, together with the exclusive right to manufacture in the said
country, or to sell therein, the goods bearing the mark assigned.

(2) The foregoing provision does not impose upon the countries of the Union
any obligation to regard as valid the assignment of any mark the use of
which by the assignee would, in fact, be of such a nature as to mislead the
public, particularly as regards the origin, nature, or essential qualities,
of the goods to which the mark is applied.

                            Article 6quinquies

A. (1) Every trademark duly registered in the country of origin shall be
accepted for filing and protected as is in the other countries of the
Union, subject to the reservations indicated in this Article. Such
countries may, before proceeding to final registration, require the
production of a certificate of registration in the country of origin,
issued by the competent authority. No authentication shall be required for
this certificate.

(2) Shall be considered the country of origin the country of the Union
where the applicant has a real and effective industrial or commercial
establishment, or, if he has no such establishment within the Union, the
country of the Union where he has his domicile, or, if he has no domicile
within the Union but is a national of a country of the Union, the country
of which he is a national.

B. Trademarks covered by this Article may be neither denied registration
nor invalidated except in the following cases:

  1. when they are of such a nature as to infringe rights acquired by
     third parties in the country where protection is claimed;

  2. when they are devoid of any distinctive character, or consist
     exclusively of signs or indications which may serve, in trade, to
     designate the kind, quality, quantity, intended purpose, value, place
     of origin, of the goods, or the time of production, or have become
     customary in the current language or in the bona fide and established
     practices of the trade of the country where protection is claimed;

  3. when they are contrary to morality or public order and, in
     particular, of such a nature as to deceive the public. It is
     understood that a mark may not be considered contrary to public order
     for the sole reason that it does not conform to a provision of the
     legislation on marks, except if such provision itself relates to
     public order.

This provision is subject, however, to the application of Article 10bis.

C. (1) In determining whether a mark is eligible for protection, all the
factual circumstances must be taken into consideration, particularly the
length of time the mark has been in use.

(2) No trademark shall be refused in the other countries of the Union for
the sole reason that it differs from the mark protected in the country of
origin only in respect of elements that do not alter its distinctive
character and do not affect its identity in the form in which it has been
registered in the said country of origin.

D. No person may benefit from the provisions of this Article if the mark
for which he claims protection is not registered in the country of origin.

E. However, in no case shall the renewal of the registration of the mark in
the country of origin involve an obligation to renew the registration in
the other countries of the Union in which the mark has been registered.

F. The benefit of priority shall remain unaffected for applications for the
registration of marks filed within the period fixed by Article 4, even if
registration in the country of origin is effected after the expiration of
such period.

                             Article 6sexies

The countries of the Union undertake to protect service marks. They shall
not be required to provide for the registration of such marks.

                             Article 6septies

(1) If the agent or representative of the person who is the proprietor of a
mark in one of the countries of the Union applies, without such
proprietor's authorization, for the registration of the mark in his own
name, in one or more countries of the Union, the proprietor shall be
entitled to oppose the registration applied for or demand its cancellation
or, if the law of the country so allows, the assignment in his favor of the
said registration, unless such agent or representative justifies his
action.

(2) The proprietor of the mark shall, subject to the provisions of
paragraph (1), above, be entitled to oppose the use of his mark by his
agent or representative if he has not authorized such use.

(3) Domestic legislation may provide an equitable time limit within which
the proprietor of a mark must exercise the rights provided for in this
Article.

                              Article 7

The nature of the goods to which a trademark is to be applied shall in no
case form an obstacle to the registration of the mark.

                            Article 7bis

(1) The countries of the Union undertake to accept for filing and to
protect collective marks belonging to associations the existence of which
is not contrary to the law of the country of origin, even if such
associations do not possess an industrial or commercial establishment.

(2) Each country shall be the judge of the particular conditions under
which a collective mark shall be protected and may refuse protection if the
mark is contrary to the public interest.

(3) Nevertheless, the protection of these marks shall not be refused to any
association the existence of which is not contrary to the law of the
country of origin, on the ground that such association is not established
in the country where protection is sought or is not constituted according
to the law of the latter country.

                              Article 8

A trade name shall be protected in all the countries of the Union without
the obligation of filing or registration, whether or not it forms part of a
trademark.

                              Article 9

(1) All goods unlawfully bearing a trademark or trade name shall be seized
on importation into those countries of the Union where such mark or trade
name is entitled to legal protection.

(2) Seizure shall likewise be effected in the country where the unlawful
affixation occurred or in the country into which the goods were imported.

(3) Seizure shall take place at the request of the public prosecutor, or
any other competent authority, or any interested party, whether a natural
person or a legal entity, in conformity with the domestic legislation of
each country.

(4) The authorities shall not be bound to effect seizure of goods in
transit.

(5) If the legislation of a country does not permit seizure on importation,
seizure shall be replaced by prohibition of importation or by seizure
inside the country.

(6) If the legislation of a country permits neither seizure on importation
nor prohibition of importation nor seizure inside the country, then, until
such time as the legislation is modified accordingly, these measures shall
be replaced by the actions and remedies available in such cases to
nationals under the law of such country.

                              Article 10

(1) The provisions of the preceding Article shall apply in cases of direct
or indirect use of a false indication of the source of the goods or the
